# DemoDH

6 automated tests.
Three of these tests are for the UI and three are for the API. 
The UI tests are negative scenarios for login with invalid credentials and for creating a new account with invalid credentials. 
The API tests verify that the response we receive is in compliance with our AC. 
The user stories are written in the Gherkin language and can be found in the 'resources/features' directory. 
The implementation of these tests is in the 'step_definitions' directory. To run the tests, go to the 'runners/CukesRunner'  directory."
